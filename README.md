spy-js documentation and samples
=====

Full documentation writing is in progress, in short for now:

Install node.js v0.8 or newer from http://nodejs.org

Download latest version from http://spy-js.com

Windows users can use spy-js.exe, other platform users (and windows users if spy-js.exe doesn't work) should use: 
<code>node spy.js</code> 
(and manually configure browser proxy settings to use spy-js URL, by default localhost:3546)

See sampleConfig.js as an example of configuration file.

spy-js tool source code itself is not open, please refer to the tool EULA for more details.
