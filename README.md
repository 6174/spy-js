Windows users can use spy-js.exe, other platform users (and windows users if spy-js.exe doesn't work) should run: 
```shell
node spy.js
```
and manually configure browser proxy settings to use spy-js URL, by default localhost:3546

See sampleConfig.js as an example of configuration file.

#### Known issues
If tracing doesn't work (and console output or log file doesn't contain any explanation): 
* make sure that browser proxy settings are using spy-js URL (by default localhost:3546)
* make sure traced website scripts are not cached in browser (clear the cache if required)
* tracing https websites is not supported at the moment
* integrated windows authentication is not supported
