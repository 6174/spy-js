# spy-js documentation and samples

This is a short version of documentation, full documentation version is in progress.

Feel free to ask your questions [on stackoverflow with spy-js tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=javascript+spy-js) or [in the repository issues](https://github.com/spy-js/spy-js/issues).

#### Installation
Install node.js v0.8 or newer from [nodejs website](http://nodejs.org).

Download latest version from [spy-js website](http://spy-js.com) and extract it from downloaded archive.

Windows users can use spy-js.exe, other platform users (and windows users if spy-js.exe doesn't work) should run: 
```shell
node spy.js
```
and manually configure browser proxy settings to use spy-js URL (by default localhost:3546).

#### Configuration
After launching spy-js UI you can start global tracing session without specifing any configuration. The session will trace all scripts from proxied traffic using default configuration parameters. 

To trace specific URL and configure what and how you'd like to trace, supply configuration in a form of a saved config file path on UI startup (or in a form of ad-hoc code any time after startup in configuration popup). See [sampleConfig.js](https://github.com/spy-js/spy-js/blob/master/sampleConfig.js) as an example of configuration file and description of what and how can be configured.

#### Known issues
If tracing doesn't work (and console output or log file doesn't contain any explanation): 
* make sure that browser proxy settings are using spy-js URL (by default localhost:3546)
* make sure traced website scripts are not cached in browser (clear the cache if required)
* tracing https websites is not supported at the moment
* integrated windows authentication is not supported
